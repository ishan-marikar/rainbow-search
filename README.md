# rainbow-search

![alt text][logo]

A simple module/script to extract the names, telephone numbers and addresses from http://rainbowpages.lk/   
The code is rather buggy, and I'll be trying to fix this soon, but meanwhile, yeah, this is all.
Also, it's a tad bit slow and all, at least for me, because the the site has a really high ping (2000ms with 3 test ICMP packets)

**This was a simple weekend project and I sincerly hope I don't get sued by SLT Telecom for this.**
